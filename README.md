# CMSC 13600

This is a template repository.  You will use git to make a copy of these files, make changes and add files, and use git to arrange and share your changes. 

## Getting started: github classroom  

Your first step will be to **fork** this template repository.  This (along with pull request creation and mangement) is a step that must be done on the github website; everything else can and should be done with git on the command line.  **Forking** creates a copy of the git repository and its history at the time of forking and gives you, the user, control over the copy.  

Next, you need to make a **git clone** of your fork.  Do this on the command line:  open gitbash (on Windows) or Terminal (on Macos or linux), change directory to a location on your hard drive suitable to place your project, and enter

git clone XXXXX

You will make changes to your git history on your computer.  When you are ready to share your changes, you will use **git push** to share your local changes with the cloud.  

## CMSC 13600 Course Project
We will use a running quarter-long course project to reinforce the material taught in the class. One of the hardest aspects of data engineering is understanding all of the software tooling and why it exists. In this project, you will design a working web-application from start to finish. Each week you will have to build a different component. We will try our best to simulate the development practices you would see in the software industry in terms of version control, unit testing, and documentation. 

The requirements and epecifications for the weekly homeworks and the AttendanceChimp project are described in
